# 📋 Tasklify: Task Tracker App

This is the starter codebase for **Week 6** of the **Uptick Talent Fellowship (Frontend Track)**.

## 📌 Task Overview

The objective of this task is to build a **Task Tracker App** using **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and modern frontend tools. This task focuses on implementing **advanced state management**, including CRUD operations, filtering, and more.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React** – UI Library
- 🧰 **Redux Toolkit** – State management
- 🛠️ **TypeScript** – Type-safe code
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- 🧪 **Jest & React Testing Library** – For unit testing (optional but encouraged)

---

## 🎯 Core Features (To Be Implemented)

- Add new task
- Edit task
- Delete task
- Mark task as completed/incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (All / Active / Completed)
- Persist state (optional: using localStorage)
- Unit test at least one reducer and one component

---

## 📁 Folder Structure (Planned)

```
src/
├── app/ # Redux store configuration
├── components/ # Reusable UI components
├── features/ # Feature-based state slices
│ └── tasks/ # Task slice, components & types
├── types/ # Global TypeScript types
├── utils/ # Utility functions (if any)
└── index.tsx # Entry point
```

---

## 📄 Goals
This project will help reinforce understanding of:

- Redux state management using createSlice and createAsyncThunk
- Component-driven development in React
- Proper project structuring and separation of concerns
- Writing atomic commits with clear messages
- Writing unit tests for reducers and components
